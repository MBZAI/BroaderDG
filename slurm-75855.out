- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1 and are newly initialized: ['bert.embeddings.prompt_tokens']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
